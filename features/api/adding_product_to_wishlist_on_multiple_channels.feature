  I want to be able to add products to my wishlist on 2 different channels

  Background:
    Given the store operates on a channel named "Web-US" in "USD" currency
    And the store also operates on another channel named "Web-EU" in "EUR" currency
    And the store has a product "Leprechaun's Gold" priced at "$100.00" available in channel "Web-US" and channel "Web-EU"
    And the store has a product "Leprechaun's Silver" priced at "â‚¬10.00" in "Web-EU" channel
    And all store products appear under a main taxonomy

  @api

    Given I am browsing channel "Web-EU"
    And user has a wishlist
    When user adds product "Leprechaun's Silver" to the wishlist in "Web-EU"
